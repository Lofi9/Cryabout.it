Core of cryabout.it website, containing hurt feelings report, and (hopefuly more) built on elixir. Managed by Nocturnal and Ino.

Insert other funny stuff here i guess

Got in an internet arguement and lost? Called mean names at the company picnic? Left out of lunch plans by your so called "friends" again? Most importantly.. were your feelings hurt? Then this is the place for you! Cryabout.it has a hurt feelings report, (redacted other methods mayhaps listed here). Just for you to tell everyone how much of a sensitive loser you are!
